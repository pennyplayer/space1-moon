# space1-moon
A second year university assignment where I used Matlab to plot the trajectory of a satellite heading to the moon.

Instructions
Run the simulation from tracker3D.m which contains the main file.  It should produce a 3D plot of the path of a satellite in a Trans-Lunar Injection maneuver (TLI).
This takes into account the gravitational effects of the Sun, Earth and Moon system on the satellite and ignores all other perturbations.  It assumes both the moon and
sun move around the earth.  This includes a perfectly circular lunar orbit with the RAAN of 140 degrees (as it was in September 2013) and straight line motion for the sun.  

It was developed on Matlab R2011b and has not been tested on more recent versions.
